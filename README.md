Cafe Shop Management System

## Overview

This project is a Cafe Shop Management System developed as part of the CS 306 First Assignment. The system aims to organize and track the ordering process in franchise branches of a cafe. It manages information about the cafe shop, waiters, customer orders, bills, and menu items. The system simplifies the order and billing process while tracking waiter performance and cafe inventory.

## Participation Constraints

- Table served by only one waiter (One-to-Many Relationship).
